#### In to OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative mapping platform that provides comprehensive, freely accessible geospatial data. Founded in 2004, OSM allows users to contribute and edit geographical information, making it one of the most extensive and continually updated mapping projects worldwide. The platform relies on volunteers to map various features, including roads, buildings, rivers, and land use, using GPS devices, aerial imagery, and other data sources. This community-driven approach ensures that the data reflects real-world conditions and facilitates local knowledge integration.

The [OpenStreetMap License](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) grants open access, either free or at minimal cost, to both the map images and the foundational geospatial data used to create them .
