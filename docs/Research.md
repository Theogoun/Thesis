In order to have everything named and placed correctly a beyond basic understanding of a bike's structure should be researched, the following is the result of that research:

- **Terminology on Anatomy and Geometry:** Finding the correct terms for every part and measurement of the bike was the first part of the research, which was found in a security oriented review and recommendation site for everything bicycle related called "Bike Lock WIKI" in their comprehensive diagram on bike parts [here](https://www.bikelockwiki.com/parts-of-a-bike-diagram/), the most important parts are shown in the picture below. The geometry side was much simpler, being able to be condensed into one reference image with any details needed explained thoroughly in the site "GeometryGeeks.bike" in [this page](https://geometrygeeks.bike/understanding-bike-geometry/).

- **Prototype Reference:** A reference was needed to make the base prototype for the bike to take form, it would later be customized so only a temporary template was needed which was found in a [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295675697_Multi-objective_optimization_of_an_on-road_bicycle_frame_by_uniform_design_and_compromise_programming) about bicycle frame optimization by uniform design and compromise programming. From that paper the example given in the form of a picture that is shown below was taken for the length and thickness of each bike part.

```

- **Finding the "important" parts:** In order for the bike to be customized to our liking the ability to bend the frame was needed, but to do that the editable measurements should be assigned prior to the design of the bike to make sure everything was in order. Through some research on the capabilities of Blender and through consideration of the most vital parts of the bike, it was concluded that the minimum requirement of data needed were the following:
 1. Seat Angle
 2. Seat Post
 3. Seat Tube C-C
 4. Stack
 5. Reach
 6. Head Angle
 7. Head Tube
 8. Handlebar Height
 9. Fork Length
 10. Rake/Offset
 11. Wheelbase
	More information on how they are used in the [[Setting the Rig]] section.

- **Gathering Data:** A single prototype or example is not enough to make sure that the bike can be fully formed into our standards is not enough. So several examples were gathered through the site mentioned beforehand: [geometrygeeks.bike](https://geometrygeeks.bike/) and it's selection of bikes and their measurements.
