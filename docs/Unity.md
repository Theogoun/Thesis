# Unity

Unity is a powerful, cross-platform game engine and development environment that has become increasingly popular for creating real-time 3D simulations and interactive applications beyond traditional gaming. Originally designed for game development, Unity's robust physics engine, comprehensive scripting capabilities, and extensive asset pipeline make it an ideal platform for scientific simulations, urban planning visualizations, and mobility studies.

Unity serves as the central platform where all components of our active movement simulation converge. Its real-time rendering capabilities allow for dynamic visualization of complex urban environments, while its physics engine enables realistic simulation of bicycle movement and rider behavior. Unity's support for geospatial data integration, particularly through plugins like Cesium for Unity, makes it possible to create accurate representations of real-world built environments.

## Why unity

The choice of Unity for this project is driven by several key advantages:
- **Real-time simulation**: Enables interactive exploration and immediate feedback on simulation parameters
- **Physics integration**: Provides realistic movement dynamics for both bicycles and pedestrians
- **Geospatial support**: Seamless integration with Cesium SDK for accurate geographic representation
- **Extensible scripting**: C# scripting environment for implementing custom mobility algorithms and data collection
