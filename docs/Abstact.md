Walking, cycling, and other active modes of transportation offer significant health benefits by promoting an active lifestyle. They are also cost-effective and environmentally friendly, producing zero emissions. To unlock their full potential, it is essential to integrate these modes into urban mobility policies at all levels of governance.
