# NavMesh

A **NavMesh** (short for *Navigation Mesh*) is a data structure used in Unity and other game engines to facilitate pathfinding for agents in a virtual environment. NavMeshes define the walkable areas of a scene, allowing agents to navigate the environment realistically and avoid obstacles.

## How NavMesh Works In Unity? 

Î¤he NavMesh is generated by marking the navigable areas on a terrain or game level. The NavMesh system uses this data to determine the shortest or most efficient path for an agent to move from one point to another. Unity's NavMesh system involves three key components:

1. **NavMesh Agent**: Represents the entity that will navigate the NavMesh, such as an NPC. Agents are assigned properties like speed and acceleration, which influence their movement behavior. The NavMesh Agent component is responsible for finding paths and moving the agent along them .

2. **NavMesh Surface**: Defines that the NavMesh covers. By baking the NavMesh Surface, Unity generates the navigation mesh based on obstacles, walkable surfaces, and other parameters defined within the NavMesh settings .

3. **NavMesh Obstacles**: Allow obstele to be added to the NavMesh. Obstacles are particularly useful for scenarios with moving objects that agents need to navigate around. Unity provides options to set obstacles as either static (stationary) or dynamic (movable), affecting the way agents interact with these objects .

## Generating the NavMesh

To generate the NavMesh, we use the **NavMesh Surface** component. Below are the key fields and their purposes:

- **Agent Type**:  
  Specifies the type of agent (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle) for which the NavMesh is being generated. We are going to dive into more detail in the following chapters

- **Default Area**:  
  Defines the default area type (e.g., Walkable) for the NavMesh. This determines where agents can navigate.

- **Generate Links**:  
  Enables or disables the generation of off-mesh links, which allow agents to traverse gaps or jumps between surfaces.

- **Object Collection**:  
  Determines which objects in the scene are included when baking the NavMesh. This can be set to include all objects or only specific ones.

After configuring these fields, the NavMesh can be generated. Once baked, a blue overlay appears on the geometry, visually indicating the walkable areas that the **NavMesh Agent** can traverse.
