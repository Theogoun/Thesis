# 3D Environment Setup

## Cesium

Cesium is an open platform for 3D geospatial data visualization. It allows developers to create highly accurate, real-world simulations using geographic data. Cesium provides tools for streaming, visualizing, and interacting with large-scale 3D geospatial datasets, such as terrain, building models, and map imagery, in a performant and dynamic way.

Key features of Cesium include:  
- **3D Tiles**: An open standard for streaming massive 3D datasets efficiently.  
- **Integration with Real-World Data**: It supports data from sources like Google 3D Maps, OpenStreetMap, and custom datasets.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Cesium is accessible on web browsers, game engines like Unity, and standalone applications.   

In this project, Cesium is used to convert 3D map data into a Unity-compatible format.

## Cesium unity package

To utilize real-world geospatial data in Unity, we rely on the [**Cesium for Unity**](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unity/) plugin. This plugin facilitates the seamless integration of 3D geospatial data into Unity, allowing for accurate environmental simulations.

The Cesium ion Assets menu in Unity provides quick access to various geospatial data assets which we can use to generate a 3D mesh. Below are the options:

- **Cesium OSM Buildings**:  
  Adds 3D building models sourced from OpenStreetMap, ideal for urban simulations or city planning.

- **Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles**:  
  Provides highly detailed 3D tilesets for photorealistic visualizations.

- **Cesium World Terrain + Bing Maps Aerial imagery**:  
  Combines high-resolution terrain data with Bing Maps' aerial imagery for realistic 3D landscapes.

- **Cesium World Terrain + Bing Maps Aerial with Labels imagery**:  
  Similar to the above but includes labels (e.g., place names, roads) over the aerial imagery for better context.

- **Cesium World Terrain + Bing Maps Road imagery**:  
  Displays terrain data with a road map overlay, useful for navigation-focused applications.

- **Cesium World Terrain + Sentinel-2 imagery**:  
  Uses satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, providing detailed and up-to-date Earth observation data.

For our specific purpose, we are utilizing the **Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles**. These tiles provide highly detailed, photorealistic 3D visualizations, making them ideal for creating immersive and accurate simulations of real-world environments.

## Cesium Georeference Object

The **Cesium Georeference** GameObject in Unity is responsible for aligning the 3D scene with real-world geospatial coordinates. It ensures that the virtual environment corresponds accurately to the Earth's surface by defining the origin and scale of the scene. Key features include:

- **Origin Mode**:  
  Allows you to set the placement of the origin, such as using a **Cartographic Origin** (latitude, longitude, and height) or an **Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF)** coordinate system.

- **Authority**:  
  Specifies the geospatial reference system, such as **Earth Centered Earth Fixed**.

- **Origin (Longitude Latitude Height)**:  
  Lets you define the geographic location of the origin in terms of latitude, longitude, and height.

- **ECEF Coordinates**:  
  Displays the calculated Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates for the origin.

- **Scale**:  
  Adjusts the scale of the scene, which can be useful for creating simulations at different levels of detail.

- **Ellipsoid Override**:  
  Allows you to override the default Cesium Ellipsoid if a custom ellipsoid is required for specific geospatial applications.

## 3D-Mesh

The **3D-Mesh** is a 3D model of a specific geographic area created using Cesium's geospatial data. To generate the mesh we have to specify:

1. **A Terrain Provider**:  
   Choose a data source, such as **Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles** or **Cesium World Terrain**.

2. **The Coordinates**:  
   Define the location (latitude, longitude, and height) for the area of interest.


In this project, we generated a 3D-Mesh of the **Geopolis Campus** in Larisa, Greece.
