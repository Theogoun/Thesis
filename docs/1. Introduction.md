### Project Summary

This thesis focuses on the development of an **active movement simulation in a built environment** using the **cesium SDK, Unity, and Blender**. The project involves creating a **simplified 3D representation of a real environment** by integrating **geospatial data** from **google maps** retrieved via the **cesium SDK**. This basic model is **enhanced with custom 3D elements** created in Blender to improve visual accuracy and better render the main structures. Once the elements are assembled in Unity, they are used for **simulating active movement** and its interactions, providing valuable insights into how it operates and responds in a built environment.{cite}`wallace2006`
