## Conclusion

In conclusion, this thesis successfully delivers a Unity-based simulation framework that integrates Cesium-generated 3D urban meshes, parametrically configurable bicycles created via Blender and YAML-driven scripting, and NavMesh agents for realistic cyclist and pedestrian movement in built environments like the Geopolis Campus in Larisa, Greece. The application enables interactive scenario creation, real-time pathfinding with obstacle avoidance, and first-person camera perspectives, providing researchers and urban planners with an accessible tool for both conducting active mobility studies and demonstrating findings—distinguishing it from complex alternatives through its intuitive interface and real-world geospatial fidelity.

Development overcame key challenges, including bicycle geometry data sourcing from specialized references like GeometryGeeks.bike and research papers, alongside technical hurdles in rigging constraints, inverse kinematics for biker posing, and Unity integration during thesis production.

Future enhancements could incorporate additional vehicle types (e.g., cars), dynamic location switching via Cesium's geospatial assets, advanced pedestrian AI with crowd behaviors, and CSV-based real-world trajectory imports for validation against empirical data.
