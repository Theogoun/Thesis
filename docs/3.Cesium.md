## What is Cesium?

Cesium is an open platform for 3D geospatial data visualization. It allows developers to create highly accurate, real-world simulations using geographic data. Cesium provides tools for streaming, visualizing, and interacting with large-scale 3D geospatial datasets, such as terrain, building models, and map imagery, in a performant and dynamic way.

Key features of Cesium include:  
- **3D Tiles**: An open standard for streaming massive 3D datasets efficiently.  
- **Integration with Real-World Data**: It supports data from sources like Google 3D Maps, OpenStreetMap, and custom datasets.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Cesium is accessible on web browsers, game engines like Unity, and standalone applications.   

In this project, Cesium is used to convert 3D map data into a Unity-compatible format.

## Importing the 3D Mesh into Unity

To utilize real-world geospatial data in Unity, we rely on the [**Cesium for Unity**](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unity/) plugin. This plugin facilitates the seamless integration of 3D geospatial data into Unity, allowing for accurate environmental simulations.
